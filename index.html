          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br />
          honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

          ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

          ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find

          developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal

        <p class="review">
          ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br />
          never written a line of code. I needed <br />
          some structure from professionals <br />
          who can help me learn programming <br />
          step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
          enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
          who can only say wonderful things <br />
          about the program. The entire <br />
          curriculum and staff did not <br />
          disappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
          and I never had to wait long for <br />
          assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
          particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
          my learning to the next level in a way <br />
          that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
          fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br />
          interviews as an example of my <br />
          developent experience. It certainly helped <br />
          me land a job as a full-stack <br />
          developer after receiving multiple <br />
          offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
